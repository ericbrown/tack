## The Problem

You return from a wildlife shoot with 3,000+ photos. Now you spend **hours** squinting at eyes, zooming to 100%, trying to find the keepers.

Most shots are soft—motion blur, missed focus, blink. The 200 sharp ones are buried in there somewhere. Finding them takes forever.

**Existing AI cullers don't help.** Tools like Aftershoot and FilterPixel are trained exclusively on wedding and portrait photography. They look for *human* faces. They don't know where a heron's eye is. They don't understand feather detail. They fail completely on wildlife.

## The Solution

Tack uses computer vision models trained specifically on **bird and wildlife anatomy** to automatically identify the sharpest images in your collection.

Point it at a folder. Get your keepers. What used to take 3 hours now takes 5 minutes.

## How It Works

1. **Select a folder** of photos from your shoot
2. **AI analyzes every image** — locating eyes, measuring sharpness, detecting motion blur
3. **Review the results** — sharp images on the left, rejects on the right
4. **Fine-tune if needed** — drag images between columns, adjust the keep percentage
5. **Export to Lightroom** — writes XMP sidecars with star ratings and Pick/Reject flags

Open Lightroom, import the folder, and your culling is already done.

## Features

### Wildlife-Specific Eye Detection
Trained on thousands of bird and mammal photos. Knows where to look for eyes on a kingfisher, an owl, a fox, or an elk. Not just human faces.

### Intelligent Sharpness Scoring
Measures sharpness precisely where it matters—on the eye. Ranks your entire shoot so the best images rise to the top.

### Motion Blur Detection
Automatically identifies images ruined by camera shake or subject movement. No more zooming to 100% on every frame.

### RAW File Support
Works directly with CR2, CR3, NEF, ARW, RAF, DNG, ORF, RW2, and more. No need to export JPEGs first.

### Seamless Lightroom Integration
Exports XMP sidecar files with star ratings and color labels. Your images arrive in Lightroom pre-flagged as Picks or Rejects.

### Works Offline
All processing happens locally on your machine. Your photos never leave your computer. No cloud uploads, no privacy concerns.

### Built for Speed
Analyzes hundreds of images per minute on Apple Silicon. Process an entire memory card while you grab coffee.

## Why Tack?

### "But I can just use Aftershoot..."

You can try. Aftershoot, FilterPixel, and similar tools are excellent—for weddings. They're trained on human faces, human poses, human expressions.

Point them at a folder of bird photos and watch them struggle. They don't know a bird's eye from a branch. They don't understand that feather detail matters. They weren't built for this.

**Tack was built specifically for wildlife.** Every training image was a bird or mammal. Every feature decision was made with wildlife photographers in mind.

### Built by a wildlife photographer

I got tired of spending more time culling than shooting. After a productive morning at the wetlands, I'd spend the entire afternoon squinting at thumbnails.

So I built the tool I wanted. One that actually understands wildlife images.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Tack work with Capture One?</strong></summary>

Yes. Tack writes standard XMP sidecar files that Capture One can read. Your ratings and labels will appear when you import the folder.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about other DAM software?</strong></summary>

Any software that reads XMP sidecars should work, including Photo Mechanic, Bridge, and others. The star ratings and labels are stored in industry-standard XMP format.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use Tack offline?</strong></summary>

Yes. After initial license activation, Tack works completely offline. All image analysis happens locally on your machine. Your photos never leave your computer.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if the AI makes mistakes?</strong></summary>

It will sometimes. No AI is perfect. That's why Tack shows you all results for review—you can drag any image between the "Sharp" and "Reject" columns before exporting. Think of it as a first pass that catches 90% of the obvious rejects.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work on insects/reptiles/fish?</strong></summary>

The current models are optimized for birds and mammals. Support for other subjects is on the roadmap.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I adjust how strict the culling is?</strong></summary>

Yes. Use the threshold slider to keep more or fewer images. Slide toward "Keep More" for challenging shooting conditions, or toward "Keep Less" when you want only the absolute best.
